'''
If the amusement park were to implement a discount for seniors, you could add
    one more conditional test to the code to determine whether someone qualified
    for the senior discount. Letâ€™s say that anyone 65 or older pays half the
    regular admission, or $20.
    '''

age = int(input("How old are you?: "))

if age < 4:
    price = 0
elif age < 18:
    price = 25
elif age < 65:
    price = 40
else:
    price = 20

print(f"Your admission cost is {price}.")
