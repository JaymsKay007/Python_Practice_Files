Instructions to teacher...
Write a program that convert their scores to grades. By the end of the program, you should have a new dictionary called
student_grades that should contain students names for keys and their grades for values.
The final version of students_grades dictionary will be checked.
DO NOT modify the existing students_grades dictionary.
DO NOT write any print statements.
This is the score criteria...
Score 91 - 100: Grades = "Outstanding"
Score 81 - 90: Grades = "Exceeds expectation"
Score 71 - 80: Grades = "Acceptable"
Score 70 or lower: Grades = "Fail"
